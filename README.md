# 🧬 Gene Variant Pathogenicity Predictor

An analysis application that allows users to simulate **single-nucleotide variations (SNVs)** in genes and predict whether they are **“likely benign”** or **“likely pathogenic”**, using the **Evo2 LLM Model**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project consists of:

- A **modified Evo2 LLM** tokenizer for efficient inference with SNVs.
- A **Next.js frontend** to display gene information, allow input of nucleotide changes, and view predictions.
- Deployment to a **Modal container**, bundling the Evo2 model with custom tweaks.

---

## 🧪 Functionality

- View gene details and reference sequences.
- Introduce a single-nucleotide variation in the sequence.
- Predict the impact of that mutation using the Evo2 LLM.
- Classify the result as:
  - `Likely Benign`
  - `Likely Pathogenic`

---

## 🛠️ Modifications

After cloning the original **Evo2** Repository, a small change was made in the tokenizer when trying to run in the **Modal** Container (It is recommended to use `H100 GPUs`):

```python
# File: vortex/model/tokenizer.py (under CharLevelTokenizer)

def tokenize(self, text: str):
    return list(np.frombuffer(text.encode("utf-8"), dtype=np.uint8))
```

The updated Evo2 directory is added to the Modal container with (as mentioned under main.py):
```python
.add_local_dir("evo2", remote_path="/evo2", ignore=["*.venv", "*.ipynb"], copy=True)
```

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Next.js with `ShadCN`** – frontend UI for sequence interaction

- **Python (with Modal)** – model backend for Evo2 inference

- **Evo2 LLM** – large language model for protein/nucleotide analysis [<img src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=25&id=467&format=png&color=ffffff">](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2)

- **NumPy, Pandas, FastAPI, Matplotlib** – backend utility libraries

- **Scikit-learn** - for evaluation metrics

## 📦 Setup & Usage

1. Clone and install dependencies (from their respective directories)
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   ```bash
   cd frontend/
   npm install
   ```

2. Modify the Evo2 tokenizer (already included if using this repo) 

3. Run locally (Modal / Backend):
    ```bash
    cd backend/
    modal init 
    modal run main.py
    ``` 

4. Start the Next.js frontend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend/
    npm run dev
    ```
